MicroBenchmarks

- Compute Flops
- Mem Bandwidth
- Cache latency
- Cache bandwidth
- Sh Mem bw
- Sh Mem latency
- PCIe H2D2H latency/bw

Benchmarks

1) Vector Add
Run code - get stats
Build perf estimates
Compare. 
Explain diff.
Use this example to validate microbenchmark results

2) Mat Mul
Use this to validate things like sh mem and bw etc

Use above two to refine model and estimation technique

Select another 2 or 3 apps to model and improve based on estimates

Declare that we are awesome.

The end.
